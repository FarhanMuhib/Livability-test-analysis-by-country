Country Livability Analysis Project 🌍✨
This project delivers an extensive analysis of global country data, creating a quantified livability score and sector rankings based on socioeconomic and environmental factors.

Project Overview 📊🔍
Combining population, economy, infrastructure, environment, social, health, and governance data, this project ranks countries on livability using SQL for data processing and normalization with a detailed scoring system.

Data Collection Challenges & Learning Journey 🚧📚🤖
Collecting high-quality data was far more challenging than expected! 📉 Learning SQL and Power BI simultaneously meant frequent back-and-forth juggling between mastering tools and refining data quality. I leveraged AI-powered assistance with tailored prompts 🧠💡, which was invaluable in gathering the precise data needed to fuel the analysis. This dynamic process strengthened both technical and problem-solving skills.

Data Description 🗂️
countries_complete.csv: Raw country metrics across demographics, economy, environment, health, literacy, politics, and more.

country_status.csv: Processed sector scores for economics, quality of life, infrastructure, environment safety, social development, and governance freedom.

livability-score.csv: Final aggregated livability scores to rank countries.

country-analysis.sql: SQL script automating data import, normalization, scoring, and final ranking calculations.

Methodology ⚙️
Each sector is scored by normalizing indicators like GDP, unemployment, life expectancy, healthcare quality, internet use, air/water quality, literacy, religious diversity, population density, political rights, and civil liberties—weighted to reflect livability's multidimensional nature.

Visual Analysis with Power BI 📈🎨
Power BI dashboards offer interactive, insightful visualizations spanning overall livability rankings, sector scores, and individual country profiles—enhancing trend exploration, comparison, and presentation.

Usage 🚀
